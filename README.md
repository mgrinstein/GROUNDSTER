# SPACE LINK

This project simulates a basic satellite that sends telemetry data (in JSON format) over a TCP socket to a ground station. Itâ€™s a minimal demo of how real-world space systems communicate telemetry from spacecraft to Earth.

## Requirements

### C++ Satellite Simulator
- C++11 or later
- `g++` compiler
- Unix-like system (Linux/macOS)

### Python Ground Station
- Python 3.x

## Instructions

### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mgrinstein/space-link.git
cd space-link
```

### 2. Compile the Satellite Simulator (Telemetry sender)

```bash
cd satellite-simulator
g++ -std=c++11 -o satellite_simulator main.cpp
```

### 3. Run the Ground Station (Receiver)
In a separate terminal, run:
```bash
cd ground-station-receiver
python3 main.py
```

### 4. Run the Satellite Simulator
Back in the simulator terminal, run:
```bash
cd satellite-simulator
./satellite_simulator
```
You should see telemetry JSON being printed on the ground station side according to the configurations of the simulator.
